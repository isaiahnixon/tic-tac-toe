# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Purpose

This is a pretty classic beggining project in a framework. The goal was to convert this to the Hooks API, which is done. Eventually, I would like to experiment with unit tests.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your machine.

### Prerequisites

* **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)**
* **[Git](https://git-scm.com/)**

#### Windows

* **[Git for Windows](https://git-for-windows.github.io/)**

### Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/isaiahnixon/tic-tac-toe
```

```
cd tic-tac-toe
```

```
npm install
```

```
npm start
```

Now the application should be running on [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).
